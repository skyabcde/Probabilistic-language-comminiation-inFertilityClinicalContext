Introductions of R scripts in file "R_scripts":

The files "00_FP data loaded" and "00_HCP data loaded" source FP and HCP data from Qualtrics. 
The files "01_FP clean data" and "02_HCP clean data" handle the cleanup of FP and HCP data based on cluster categorization and provide descriptive statistics, including the number of participants affected by the data exclusion process. 
The files "03a_FP" and "04a_HCP" document the codes used for categorization, which informed the cleaning processes in "01_FP clean data" and "02_HCP clean data". 
The files "03b_FP" and "04b_HCP" outline the exclusion criteria for Ordering tasks, while "03c_FP" and "04c_HCP" detail the exclusion criteria for Rating tasks, both of which were applied during the data cleaning process. 
"Supplementary_File_3" provides theoretical details on the categorization process. 

The file "05_Inferential analysis ordering" describes the inferential analysis used to compare the congruence of ordering response distributions between HCP and FP, as well as the variance comparisons between sub-groups and within-subject variations. 
Similarly, "06_Inferential analysis rating" details the inferential analysis for comparing rating response distributions and variance comparisons. 
"Supplementary_File_4" contains the theoretical background for the inferential analyses.

The file "07_Descriptive_analysis.Rmd" presents the descriptive analysis of the data, including tables and figures. 
The file "08_FP_HCP_tasks_corr" explores the ordinal correlation between ordering and rating responses within FP and HCP sub-groups.
